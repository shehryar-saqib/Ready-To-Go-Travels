              </p>
              <p class="fst-italic">
                The best time to visit Pakistan depends on where you want to travel. The period from May till October is generally considered the perfect season to visit, as the climate is rather warm and dry throughout the country.

              <p class="fst-italic">If you wish to visit the northwest districts of Pakistan, like Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, or even Balochistan, then October-February would be the best time to travel, as the weather will be cold enough for you to enjoy your tour.</p>

              <h3>Travel Restriction Update 2022</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">
                Pakistan had been one of the countries that were severely hit by Covid and both the economy and humanity suffered huge losses. And Pakistan put travel restrictions to minimze the damage and both the domestic and international travelling were banned for a while. Then things started to ease and Pakistan opened its borders for tourists around mid 2021 but international tourists had to undergo rigorous PCR tests. It continued for a while and then in summer of 2022, Government of Pakistan decided to finally lift all restrictions and the country was open to all kinds of tourist activities without requiring to go through the covid testing at the airports on arrival. At the time of publishing this article in December, 2022 , there is NO Restriction on Pakistan Travel both domestically and internationally.
